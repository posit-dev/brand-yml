Description: Read and process 'brand.yml' 'YAML' files. 'brand.yml' is a
    simple, portable YAML file that codifies your company's brand
    guidelines into a format that can be used by 'Quarto', 'Shiny' and R
    tooling to create branded outputs. Maintain unified, branded theming
    for web applications to printed reports to dashboards and
    presentations with a consistent look and feel.
