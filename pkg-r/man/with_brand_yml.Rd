\title{Temporarily set the BRAND_YML_PATH environment variable}
\usage{
with_brand_yml(path, code)

local_brand_yml(path, .local_envir = parent.frame())
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{The path to a brand.yml file.}

\item{code}{\code{[any]}\cr Code to execute in the temporary environment}

\item{.local_envir}{\verb{[environment]}\cr The environment to use for scoping.}
}
\description{
This function sets the \code{BRAND_YML_PATH} environment variable to the specified
path for the duration of the local environment. This ensures that, for the
scope of the local environment, any calls to functions that automatically
discover a \verb{_brand.yml} file will use the path specified.
}
\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{with_brand_yml()}: Run code in a temporary environment with the
\code{BRAND_YML_PATH} environment variable set to \code{path}.

\item \code{local_brand_yml()}: Set the \code{BRAND_YML_PATH} environment variable for
the scope of the local environment (e.g. within the current function).
