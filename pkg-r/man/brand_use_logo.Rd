\title{Extract a logo resource from a brand}
\usage{
brand_use_logo(
  brand,
  name,
  variant = c("auto", "light", "dark"),
  ...,
  required = FALSE,
  allow_fallback = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{brand}{A brand object from \code{\link[=read_brand_yml]{read_brand_yml()}} or \code{\link[=as_brand_yml]{as_brand_yml()}}.}

\item{name}{The name of the logo to use. Either a size (\code{"small"},
\code{"medium"}, \code{"large"}) or an image name from \code{brand.logo.images}.}

\item{variant}{Which variant to use, only used when \code{name} is one of the
brand.yml fixed logo sizes (\code{"small"}, \code{"medium"}, or \code{"large"}). Can be
one of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"auto"}: Auto-detect, returns a light/dark logo resource if both
variants are present, otherwise it returns a single logo resource, either
the value for \verb{brand.logo.\{name\}} or the single light or dark variant if
only one is present.
\item \code{"light"}: Returns only the light variant. If no light variant is
present, but \verb{brand.logo.\{name\}} is a single logo resource and
\code{allow_fallback} is \code{TRUE}, \code{brand_use_logo()} falls back to the single
logo resource.
\item \code{"dark"}: Returns only the dark variant, or, as above, falls back to the
single logo resource if no dark variant is present and \code{allow_fallback}
is \code{TRUE}.
\item \code{c("light", "dark")}: Returns a light/dark object with both variants. If
a single logo resource is present for \verb{brand.logo.\{name\}} and
\code{allow_fallback} is \code{TRUE}, the single logo resource is promoted to a
light/dark logo resource with identical light and dark variants.
}}

\item{...}{Ignored, must be empty.}

\item{required}{Logical or character string. If \code{TRUE}, an error is thrown if
the requested logo is not found. If a string, it is used to describe why
the logo is required in the error message and completes the phrase
\code{"is required ____"}.}

\item{allow_fallback}{If \code{TRUE} (the default), allows falling back to a
non-variant-specific logo when a specific variant is requested. Only used
when \code{name} is one of the fixed logo sizes (\code{"small"}, \code{"medium"}, or
\code{"large"}).}
}
\value{
A \code{brand_logo_resource} object, a \code{brand_logo_resource_light_dark}
object, or \code{NULL} if the requested logo doesn't exist and \code{required} is
\code{FALSE}.
}
\description{
Returns a brand logo resource specified by name and variant from a brand
object. The image paths in the returned object are adjusted to be absolute,
relative to the location of the brand YAML file, if \code{brand} was read from a
file, or the local working directory otherwise.
