## About

Individual formats and outputs can expose format-specific variables or options that are relevant to branding.
These options are tied to a specific output format or context, so they can't be included in the core brand specification.
But they are still relevant to the brand and need a place within brand.yml.

## Structure

::: callout-warning
This section of brand.yml is not as well-sepecified as the other sections, by design.
As brand.yml adoption grows, new tools will need to be able to store options specific to the tool.
This part of the brand.yml spec may change as we learn more about the needs of different tools.
:::

Currently, both Quarto and Shiny support a `bootstrap` section under `defaults` that can be used to set default values for Bootstrap Sass variables.

```{.yaml filename="brand.yml"}
defaults:
  bootstrap:
    defaults:
      enable-rounded: false
      link-decoration: none
```

In [Shiny for Python](https://shiny.posit.co/py/api/core/ui.Theme.html), an additional `shiny.theme` section is used to set default values for Shiny-specific theme settings.

```{.yaml filename="brand.yml"}
color:
  palette:
    pink: "#E83E8C"
defaults:
  shiny:
    theme:
      preset: shiny
      defaults:
        bslib-dashboard-design: false
      rules: |
        .navbar-brand { color: $brand-pink }
```

Note that in these sections, you can make use of brand features, like the addition of [`$brand-{color}` Sass variables](color.qmd#automatic-color-definitions).
