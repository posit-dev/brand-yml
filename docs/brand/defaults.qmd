## About

Individual formats and outputs can expose format-specific variables or options that are relevant to branding. 
These options are tied to a specific output format or context, so they can't be included in the core brand specification.
But they are still relevant to the brand and need a place within `brand.yml`.

For example, [Quarto slides expose a set of Sass variables](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/themes.html#sass-variables) while HTML documents and Shiny apps [use Sass variables set by Bootstrap](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/articles/bs5-variables/index.html).

On the other hand, some theme-relevant settings are actually format options, or are built on top of a base of format options.
For example, when creating a branded Beamer presentation, its often easier to start with a known `theme` or `colortheme`.
Or similarly, it might be easier in Bootstrap to start with a [Bootswatch theme](https://bootswatch.com/).

A source of inspiration for this section is [pkgdown's approach to template packaging](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/customise.html#template-packages), where a source template provides the initial values for `_pkgdown.yml` settings that can be overridden in local instances.
In this regard, the `template` section provides a template for the initial values of format- or output-specific settings.
An alternative name for this section could be `settings`.


## Example

```{.yaml filename="brand.yml"}
defaults:
  quarto:
    format:
      html:
        toc: true
        toc-location: left
      beamer:
        navigation: horizontal
        theme: AnnArbor
        colortheme: lily
    website:
      body-footer: Copyright 2022-2024 Posit Software, PBC
  bootstrap:
    defaults:
      enable-rounded: false
      link-decoration: none
```

## Spec

```{.yaml}
{{< include spec/brand-defaults.yml >}}
```

### Bootstrap

Some of the most basic non-color concepts found in

* <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/customize/options/>
* <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/customize/css-variables/>

If we have a `deafults.bootstrap` field, it would support the named sections used by [theme Sass files in Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes-more.html).


#### HTML basic options

Example from [Quarto HTML documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html#basic-options):

```{.markdown}
---
title: "My Document"
format:
  html: 
    theme: cosmo
    fontsize: 1.1em
    linestretch: 1.7
---
```

#### Beamer options

Example from [Quarto slides with beamer documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/beamer.html#beamer-options)

```{.markdown}
---
format: 
  beamer: 
    aspectratio: 32
    navigation: horizontal
