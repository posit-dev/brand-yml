## About

Individual formats and outputs can expose format-specific variables or options that are relevant to themes, but not global.

For example, [Quarto slides expose a set of Sass variables](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/themes.html#sass-variables) while HTML documents and Shiny apps [use Sass variables set by Bootstrap](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/articles/bs5-variables/index.html).

On the other hand, some theme-relevant settings are actually format options, or are built on top of a base of format options.
For example, when creating a branded Beamer presentation, its often easier to start with a known `theme` or `colortheme`.
Or similarly, it might be easier in Bootstrap to start with a [Bootswatch theme](https://bootswatch.com/).
