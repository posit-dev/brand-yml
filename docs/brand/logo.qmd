## About

The `logo` section in your `_brand.yml` file allows you to define and organize the logos and brand images for your project. This flexible system supports various logo sizes, light/dark variants, and the ability to store multiple image resources for different use cases.

## Structure

The `logo` field in your `_brand.yml` file can be structured in several ways, from a simple single-logo setup to a more complex configuration with multiple sizes and variants:

- [images](#images): A dictionary of named logo resources
- [small](#small): Logo for small display contexts (e.g., favicons)
- [medium](#medium): Logo for medium display contexts (e.g., website headers)
- [large](#large): Logo for large display contexts (e.g., title slides, marketing materials)

Logos can be stored locally---adjacent to your `_brand.yml` file---or hosted online.
Local file paths should be relative to the location of your `_brand.yml` file
(I'll use `logos/` as the directory in the examples below).
Online images should use full URLs starting with `http://` or `https://`.

## Examples

### Simple Single Logo

```{.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
logo: posit.png
```

### Basic Multi-size Configuration

```{.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
logo:
  small: logos/icon.png
  medium: logos/header-logo.png
  large: logos/full-logo.svg
```

### Light/Dark Variants

You can specify different logos for light and dark backgrounds by giving the `small`, `medium`, and `large` attributes a nested mapping with `light` and `dark` child elements.
"**light**" means for use on light background (or in a light color mode), and "**dark**" means for use on dark background (or in a dark color mode).

```{.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
logo:
  small: logos/icon.png
  medium:
    light: logos/header-logo.png
    dark: logos/header-logo-white.png
  large: logos/full-logo.svg
```

### Comprehensive Configuration with Named Resources

Use `images` as a nested mapping to define multiple logo resources with meaningful names.
Then, you can directly reference these resources by name in the `small`, `medium`, and `large` attributes.

```{.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
logo:
  images:
    icon: logos/icon.png
    header: logos/header-logo.png
    header-white: logos/header-logo-white.png
    full: logos/full-logo.svg
  small: icon
  medium:
    light: header
    dark: header-white
  large: full
```

### Configuration with Alternative Text

Logo images can have associated alternative text for accessibility purposes.
This can be specified as an `alt` property in the image object as the alt text is directly associated with each image.
The University of South Carolina provides a great resource on [writing effective alt text for logos](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/digital-accessibility/toolbox/best_practices/alternative_text/logo-alt-text/index.php) in their [Digital Accessibility Toolbox](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/digital-accessibility/index.php).


```{.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
logo:
  images:
    icon:
      path: logos/icon.png
      alt: "Company icon with abstract shapes"
    header:
      path: logos/header-logo.png
      alt: "Company name with logo"
    header-white:
      path: logos/header-logo-white.png
      alt: "Company name with logo in white"
    full:
      path: logos/full-logo.svg
      alt: "Full company logo with tagline"
  small: icon
  medium:
    light: header
    dark: header-white
  large: full
```

## Attributes

### images {#images}

The `images` attribute is a mapping that allows you to define multiple logo resources with meaningful names. These named resources can then be referenced in the `small`, `medium`, and `large` attributes.

```{.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
logo:
  images:
    primary: logos/primary-logo.png
    icon: logos/favicon.png
    white: logos/white-logo.png
```

Each image can be specified as a simple string path or as an object with `path` and `alt` properties:

```{.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
logo:
  images:
    primary:
      path: logos/primary-logo.png
      alt: "Company logo with name and icon"
```

### small {#small}

The `small` attribute defines the logo used for small display contexts, such as favicons or mobile app icons.

`small`, `medium` and `large` can each be a simple string path to the image or a reference to a named resource defined in the `images` attribute (shown in the second example).

:::{.grid style="--bs-columns:2"}
::: {.g-col-2 .g-col-lg-1}
```{.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
logo:
  small: logos/favicon.png
```
:::

::: {.g-col-2 .g-col-lg-1}
```{.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
logo:
  images:
    icon: logos/favicon.png
  small: icon
```
:::
:::

### medium {#medium}

The `medium` attribute specifies the logo for medium-sized display contexts, typically used in website headers or navigation bars.

`small`, `medium` and `large` can also be nested mappings with `light` and `dark` child elements to specify different logos for light and dark backgrounds (show in the second example).

::: {.grid style="--bs-columns:2"}
::: {.g-col-2 .g-col-lg-1}
```{.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
logo:
  medium: logos/header-logo.png
```
:::

::: {.g-col-2 .g-col-lg-1}
```{.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
logo:
  medium:
    light: logos/header-logo.png
    dark: logos/header-logo-white.png
```
:::
:::

### large {#large}

The `large` attribute defines the logo for large display contexts, such as title slides or marketing materials.

It has the same properties as `small` and `medium`.
Note that `light` and `dark` variants can also refer to named `images` resources (show in the second example).

::: {.grid style="--bs-columns:2"}
::: {.g-col-2 .g-col-lg-1}
```{.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
logo:
  large: logos/full-logo.svg
```
:::

::: {.g-col-2 .g-col-lg-1}
```{.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
logo:
  images:
    full: logos/full-logo.svg
    full-white: logos/full-logo-white.svg
  large:
    light: full
    dark: full-white
```
