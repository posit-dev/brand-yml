## About

The `meta` section in a `_brand.yml` provides a place to store metadata about the company or project described in the file.
This information may be used by tools that support brand.yml to add social media icons, links, footers, etc.
It can also be used as a place to store additional context about the company or brand that you'd like to store in a common place.

## Structure

The `meta` section primarily consists of two main components:

1.  [name](#name): The name of the company or brand
2.  [link](#link): URLs to the brand's online presence

Both `name` and `link` are optional fields, and you can add additional fields as needed for your specific use case.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how you might use the `meta` section in your `_brand.yml` file:

### Minimal Example

``` {.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
meta:
  name: Acme Corporation
  link: https://www.acmecorp.com
```

### Comprehensive Example

``` {.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
meta:
  name:
    full: Acme Corporation International
    short: Acme
  link:
    home: https://www.acmecorp.com
    docs: https://docs.acmecorp.com
    github: https://github.com/acmecorp
    bluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/acmecorp.bsky.social
    twitter: https://twitter.com/acmecorp
    linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/acmecorp

## Attributes

### Name {#name}

The `name` field can be specified in two ways:

1.  As a simple string, representing the full name of the company or brand:

    ``` {.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
    meta:
      name: Acme Corporation
    ```

2.  As an object with `full` and `short` properties:

    ``` {.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
    meta:
      name:
        full: Acme Corporation International
        short: Acme
    ```

    This format is useful when you need to distinguish between a full company name and a shorter version depending on context.

### Link {#link}

The `link` field can also be specified in two ways:

1.  As a simple string, representing the main website of the company or brand:

    ``` {.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
    meta:
      link: https://www.acmecorp.com
    ```

2.  As an object with multiple properties representing different online presences:

    ``` {.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
    meta:
      link:
        home: https://www.acmecorp.com
        github: https://github.com/acmecorp
        bluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/acmecorp.bsky.social
        linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/acmecorp
    ```

    This format allows you to record links to the homepage and related social media accounts used by your brand.
    Note that links should be full URLs, including the `https://` prefix.
