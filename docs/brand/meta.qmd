## About

`meta` provides a place to store metadata about the Company described in `brand.yml`.
We should anticipate a few key pieces of information,
but authors might want to include data we haven't accounted for.

## Example

```{.yaml filename="brand.yml"}
meta:
  name: Posit
  link: https://posit.co
```

```{.yaml filename="brand.yml"}
meta:
  name:
    full: Posit Software, PBC
    short: Posit
  link:
    home: https://posit.co
    guide: https://positpbc.atlassian.net/wiki/x/AQAgBQ
    mastodon: https://fosstodon.org/@Posit
    linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/posit-software/
    twitter: https://twitter.com/posit_pbc
```

## Spec

```{.yaml}
{{< include spec/brand-meta.yml >}}
```
