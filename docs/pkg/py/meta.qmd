Brand Metadata

Brand metadata is stored in `meta`, providing place to describe the company
or project, the brand guidelines, additional links, and more.

## Attributes {.doc-section .doc-section-attributes}

name

:   [BrandMetaName](`brand_yml.meta.BrandMetaName`) \| None

    The name of the brand. In the YAML, this may be a dictionary with the
    `full` and `short` forms of the brand name.

    ```yaml
    meta:
      name:
        full: Very Big Corporation of America
        short: VBCA
    ```

    or a single value as shorthand for `meta.name.full`.

    ```yaml
    meta:
      name: Very Big Corporation of America
    ```

link

:   [BrandMetaLink](`brand_yml.meta.BrandMetaLink`) \| None

    Links to additional resources related to the brand, such as its
    homepage, social media accounts, etc. Like `name`, this can be a single
    value or a dictionary with additional keys. If a single value is
    provided, it is promoted to the `home` key of
    `brand_yml.meta.BrandMetaLink`.

    These two constructions are equivalent:

    ```yaml
    meta:
      link: https://www.very-big-corp.com/
    ```

    ```yaml
    meta:
      link:
        home: https://www.very-big-corp.com/
    ```

## Notes {.doc-section .doc-section-notes}

Additional fields are allowed, so you may store any additional metadata you
want to attach to the brand here. Tools that use `brand_yml` may not know
about these fields, however.
