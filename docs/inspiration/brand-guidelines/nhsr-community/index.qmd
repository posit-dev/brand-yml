#| echo: false
from brand_yml._utils_yaml import yaml_brand as yaml
from IPython.display import Markdown

with open("_brand-nhs-r.yml", "r") as f:
    brand = yaml.load(f)

meta = yaml.dump({"meta": brand["meta"]}).strip()

```

## Colour

The NHS-R Community uses [the NHS England colours](https://www.england.nhs.uk/nhsidentity/identity-guidelines/colours/) for its branding[^colour-licence].
The colours used by NHS-R Community do not, currently, include any colours from any other nation in the UK.

[^colour-licence]:  Under the [Open Government Licence v3.0](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

``` {.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
`{python} Markdown(color)`
```

## Typography

The NHS-R Community `_brand.yml` uses the NHS-recommended font, Arial, which is assumed to be available on the user's system.
It also includes commented code for the use of [Frutiger, the official NHS font](https://www.england.nhs.uk/nhsidentity/identity-guidelines/fonts/).
Frutiger is a proprietary font that requires purchasing, so it is not used in any NHS-R Community products.

If Frutiger is available to an NHS organisation, then the lines of code under `fonts:` need to be uncommented and the output tested.


``` {.yaml filename="_brand.yml"}
`{python} Markdown(typography)`
```

## Logo

The NHS-R Community `_brand.yml` uses the [NHS-R Community logo](https://nhsrway.nhsrcommunity.com/style-guides.html#logo)[^licence-nhs-r-logo], which incorporates [the R project logo](https://www.r-project.org/logo/)[^licence-r-logo].

[^licence-nhs-r-logo]: Copies of the [NHS-R Community's logo](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/assets/tree/main/logo) are available under Creative Commons 1.0.
[^licence-r-logo]: The R project logo is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International licence.

It should be noted that the [logo for the NHS in England](https://www.england.nhs.uk/nhsidentity/identity-guidelines/nhs-logo/) is protected by law and is trade marked so can be used by official documents in the work of the NHS.
In order to use this please just replace the NHS-R Community logo with that of NHS.
